%\note{An overview of the fabrication fo 2D materials is given (\Gls{cvd}, \gls{mbe}, transfer methods). The details of the fabrication of 2D heterojunction devices is given. The heavy dependence of device characteristics to the fabrication method is discussed.}
Fabrication methods include additive (\enquote{bottom-up}) and reducing (\enquote{top-down}) processes. For the extremely thin films, that are required for 2D gas sensors, mostly additive methods are used, as the control of the layer height is much finer. The most prominent 2D film fabrication methods are \gls{mbe}, transfer methods like \gls{dep}, \gls{cvd} and its specialized method \gls{ald}. As the specific fabrication method has major impact on the final sensor performance \cite{Deng2019}, the most important techniques shall be briefly discussed here.
\subsection{Molecular Beam Epitaxy}

\Gls{mbe} is a popular method for growing thin films. Its slow growth rates (ca. \SI{3000}{\nano\meter} per hour) allow fine control over the layer thickness. The principle is based on the target material being evaporated/sublimed in a Knudsen cell. The gas then hits the wafer in the center of the chamber and adsorbs onto the surface. The process is continued until the desired film thickness is reached. This method requires an extremely high vacuum, which makes the process rather expensive, slow, and inflexible.  However, due to the high vacuum and the independence of carrier gases and precursors, \gls{mbe} yields the purest films of all fabrication methods. \Cref{fig:fabrication_mbe} shows a depiction of an \gls{mbe} 
\subsection{Dielectrophoresis}

    \label{fig:fabrication_dep}
\end{figure}
Dielectrophoretic assembly utilizes non-uniform electric fields to deposit pre-fabricated particles to abritrarilly chosen locations. This process is applicable to a wide variety of materials, that do not necessarilly have to be dielectric. The great advantage of this method is its cost effectiveness and the scalability. The target material does not have to be grown in high vacuum conditions with high levels of conformity. Rather, flakes of the target material suffice. These flakes are then assembled onto prefabricated electrodes, until they form a film of the desired thickness. As the material is deposited at low temperature and in the form of flakes, no uniform crystal is grown. This circumstance may be detrimental for some appications. Nevertheless \gls{dep} is a major contender to enable large scale production of \glspl{tmd}. \Cref{ig:fabrication_cvd} 
\subsection{Chemical Vapor Deposition}

    \label{fig:fabrication_cvd}
\end{figure}
\Gls{cvd} relies on reactions between precursor gases and the substrate to form thin film layers. The precursor are pumped through an heated (up to \SI{900}{\celsius}) reaction chamber, where their reaction products can adhere to the substrate. This process allows fast layer growth, however, due to the relatively low vacuum, and the non-ideal control over the reaction between the precursor gases, the produced material may be subjected to impurities. Due to the high temperature, crystal growth is possible.
\subsection{Atomic Layer Deposition}
\begin{figure}

    \caption{A schematic explaining \gls{ald}\cite{Johnson2014}.}
    \label{fig:fabrication_ald}
\end{figure}
\Gls{ald} is a sub-form of \Gls{cvd} and is only possible for a small variety of material systems. \Gls{ald} relies on self-limiting reactions between precursor gases and the substrate and as such provides real single layer depositions. The process yields superior uniformity accross the surface, however, due to the very specific reactions taking place, this process is only available for a few materials.
