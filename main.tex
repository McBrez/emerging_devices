\title{2D TMD Heterojunction Gas Sensors}
\author{David Freismuth}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The human intervention on the environment has never been greater than today. In order to be able to detect and observe potential dangerous changes in the atmosphere, novel gas sensors are needed. The market expects devices with superior sensing performance, high integrability and low power consumption, so that ubiquitous sensing applications are enabled. Advances in nano fabrication methods, that have been kindled by the late graphene hype, recently allowed the synthesis of high quality 2D devices. It is possible to show interesting effects with such devices, including electric sensitivity to specific gases. For that and many other favorable reasons, 2D materials are traded as the next generation of gas sensors. This paper gives an overview of conventional and novel sensing approaches and discusses the advantages and shortcomings of 2D material based gas sensors, based on two applications.
