\note{The importance of gas sensors is made clear. I.e. the need for them in the civil, industrial, medical and military sector. An overview of conventional gas sensors is given. I.e. Bulk-MOX, NDIR, catalytic bead sensor. Novel gas sensors based on 2D structures are presented. Their advantages (small size, flexibility, CMOS-compatibility, sensitivity, specificity) is discussed. Multiple 2D gas sensors are shortly presented. Eventually gas sensors based on 2D TMD heterojunctions are motivated.}
