\note{The operating principles of 2D TMD and 2D TMD heterojunction gas sensors are explained. \\
High surface-to-volume ratio $\rightarrow$ 2D material behaves differently than bulk material (increased reactivity) $\rightarrow$  analyte gas donates/accepts electrons from 2D film $\rightarrow$  carrier density of 2D film is modulated $\rightarrow$  measurable resistance change
